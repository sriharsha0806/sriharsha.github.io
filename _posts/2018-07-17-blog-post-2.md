This Blog post is on [Apollo Self Driving car course](https://www.udacity.com/apollo) By Udacity. 
# Introduction

The Apollo technology framework consists of four layers, 
1) Reference vehicle platform(Base vehicle)
2) Reference hardware platform(Velodyne Lidar, Radar and Camera)
3) Open software platform
4) Cloud service platform

Regarding Reference vehicle Platform and Reference harware platform, 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2017-55-14.png)


The open software layer is divided into three sub layers:
1) RTOS(guarantees task will be completed within a given time)
2) Runtime Framework(Operating Framework of Apollo, Customized version of ROS)
3) layer of application modules

* Apollo RTOS is a combination of Ubuntu Linux operating system and the Apollo Kernel
* In order to adapt ROS to Self-Driving Cars, The Apollo team has improved functionality and performance
for shared memory, decentralization and data comparability.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2018-13-06.png)

* Shared memory reduces the need to copy data if different modules require access. For one to many transmission 
Scenarios shared memory supports the "write once, read multiple" pattern.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2018-17-13.png)

* Decentralization solves the problem of a single point of failure. If the Master Node fails teh entire system will fail.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2018-38-37.png)

To avoid this problem, Bring all the nodes to common domain. Each node in the domain has the information about the other nodes in the domain.
Through this decentralization scheme, the common domain has replaces the original ROS Master node. Thus, the risk of a single point fo failure 
has been eliminated.

![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2018-18-14.png)

* Data Compatability is crucial. Different ROS nondes communicate with each other through ROS Message, and interface language. 
ROS Message requires a common interface language so that each node can interpret the Message data from the other nodes. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2018-43-44.png)

If the format in the Message file is even slightly different from what a node is expecting, the communication will simply fail. 
To avoid these compatability issues(Eg: When an interface is upgraded, data incompatibility will often result in system failure.
Previous recorded test data must be converted again and again to adapt to new message formats), Protobuf(another interface language) is used.
Protobuf is a method to serialize data and it is used in developing programs to communicate with each other over a wire or for storing data.
We can add new fields to message formats without breaking backwards-compatibility?
`New binaries can accept the old message format during parsing`

* Application Modules
  * MAP Engine
  * Localization
  * Perception
  * Planning
  * Control
  * Human Machine Interface
  * End-to-End driving
Each module has its own algorithm library and the relationships between the modules are complex.

* Apollo cloud services is a suite of applications that runs in teh cloud outside of the vehicle itself. 
The suite provides tools that accelerate the processing of building and training self-driving car software.
The Cloud services contain HD map, simulation, Data Platform, Security, Over the air software updates(OTA) and intelligent voice system called DuerOS.
The simulation software allows everyone to build simulation environments for their own needs. The platform also aggregates large amount of driving data 
which allows developers to verify and validate their self-driving software system. Simulation software not only helps to see the environments but also understand the role situation and the scenario.
The simulation platform has many functions
1) Allows developers to configure different driving scenarios such as obstacles, routing and traffic light states.
Execution mode provides developers a complete set up to run multiple scenarios. In execution mode, developers can upload and verify modules in Apollo environment.

Types of data required by virtual simulator
  * Traffic Lights Data
  * Obstacles with Bounding Boxes
  * Semantic Segmentation

# HD Map(Jingao Wang)
* Consists of a huge amount of driving assistance information. The most important is the accurate 
three-dimensional representation fo the road network. e.g. the layouts of intersections and locations fo signposts. It also contains lot of 
semantic information. The map might report what different colors of traffic light mean, might alos indicate the speed limit of the road and where the left turn lane begins.
The navigation map in phone achieves meter level precision but HD-Map enables the vehicle to achieve centimeter-level precision. 
We have to localize ourselves to the HDmap provided. The vehicle might look for landmarks. This matching process is a complex chain that requires preprocessing, 
Coordinate transformation, and data fusion. Preprocessing eliminates inaccurate or poor quality data. Coordination transformation converts data from different perspectives
into a uniform coordinate system. Data fusion merges data from different vehicles and different types of sensors. The entire localization process depends on the map which is why 
the vehicle needs high definition maps in order to know where it is in the world.

HD map will help the sensor narrow it's detection scope. For instance, the high definition map may tell us to look for a stop sign at a certain location and then our sensors can 
focus on that location to detect the stop sign. This is called a region of interest or ROI. `ROI can help us improve both detection accuracy and speed saving computing resources for other tasks in vehicle.

Not only localization and perception but also planning software relies on HD map. 
HD-Map will often record the precise location and height of traffic lights greatly reducing the difficult of perception.

The HD map Production in Apollo involves 
1) Data Sourcing
2) Data Processing
3) Object Detection
4) Manual Verification
5) Map Products

In addition to releasing high definition maps, Apollo also publishes corresponding localization maps with 
a top-down view and three-dimensional point cloud maps. 

# Localization
* GNSS RTK
  * Real time Kinematic Positioning(Poor Performance in Urban Area and Canyons; low frequency)
  * Time taken for GPS update 0.1s
* Inertial Navigation
  * three axis accelerometer; The accelerometer records measurements based on the coordinate frame of the vehicle. 
  * Need to translate these measurements into the global coordinate system.
  * This translation requires another sensor called gyroscope
* LIDAR
  * Point Cloud matching. The Global position and Heading of the car in HD Map. Iterative closest point or ICP is the one of
  the many algorithms for Point cloud Matching
  * To match two cloud scans, For each point in one scan we need to find the closest matching point in the other scan. 
  Eventually, we'll have gathered many matching point pairs. We sum the distance error between each pair of points and then     calculate the average distance error over the entire set. Our goal is to minimize this distance error by rotating and         translating the point clouds. Once we have minimized the summation of point clouds, we have a match between our sensor scan   and the map
  * We translate the position of our vehicle from the sensor scan to the global map and calculate our precise position of the map. 
  * Filter algorithms are another approach. They remove redundant info and find the most likely position of the vehicle on the map. Apollo uses the Histogram Filter algorithm. Kalman filter use predict update method.
  * The LIDAR sensor is Robust :) But it is difficult to update the HD Maps everytime :(
* Visual Localization
  ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-17%2022-38-24.png)
  * Particle Filter, Using particles or points on the map to estimate our most likely location. 
  * Image data is easy to obtain :)  lack of 3D information and reliance on 3D Maps :(
* Apollo Localization  
  * Fusion approach takes advantage of the complementary strenghts of different sensors. 
  * IMU< GPS , LiDar, Radar and High Definition Maps.
  ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/kalman-filter.png)
  * The inertial navigation solution is used for the prediction step of the Kalman Filter and
    GNSS and Lidar localization are used for measurement update step of the kalman Filter

# Perception

# Prediction
* Self Driving Car needs to predict the behavior of other objects so that we make the best decisions about what our own vehicle should do. We predict the behavior of an object by generating trajectory for it. 
* The Car below starts to decelerate in front of the ramp. The predicted trajectory for this car is shown by the arrow.
We make similar predictions for all the other objects in our environment.Together, they form the prediction for the timestamp.
* At each time step, we recalculate the predictions for every vehicle in the environment. 

![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-18%2000-19-50.png)

* These predictions inform the decisions our vehicle makes during th eplanning phase.
* There are two types of predictions
  * Model based prediction
  * Data driven prediction
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-18%2000-36-12.png)

In the above picture two possible scenarios were shown for white car and

# Planning
* We incorporate HD Maps, localization, and prediction to build a trajectory for the vehicle.
* First step for planning is route navigation which focuses on how to go from A to B on the map.
* Routing takes the map data as input and output a navigable path. 
* Once a high level route is constructed, we zoom into trajectory planning. Trajectory planning is making decisions to avoid obstacles and create a smooth ride for passengers. 
* The goal of trajectory planning is to generate a collision-free and comfortable trajectory to execute. This trajectory is defined by a sequence of points. Each point has an associated veolcity and a timestamp that indicates when we should arrive at that point. 
  * Routing
    Routing takes three inputs
      * Map, Apollo data Map includes the road network and real-time traffic information.
      * Our current position on the Map
      * Destination
  * World to Graph
    * Use searching to find a route. Reformat the map into a datastructure called a graph.The nodes represent sections of road and the edges represent connections those sections. 
    * We can model the cost it takes to move from one node to another
    * The advantage of converting a map to graph is that there are many fast algorithms for finding paths in a graph. It's easy to translate that path in the graph back to a route on our map.
  
Number of Nodes for the given map is 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/empty.png)
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/nodes.png)

* Grid world
  * calculate the cost it takes to travel from the start node to the candidate node. 
  * We estimate how much it costs to travel from that candidate node to the goal.(It's easy to calculate the cost to arrive at the candidate node, because it's already adjacent to us. It's harder to calculate the cost to go from the candidate node to the goal.)   

* From Routing to Trajectories
  * The high level part of the map is one step of planning process. We still have to build low-level trajecctories to move along that route(Dealing with cars, pedestrians and objects that aren't part of the map). 
  * These scenarios require lower level, high precision planning. This level of planning is called trajectory generation.
* 3D Geometry
  * The goal of trajectory generation is to generate a trajectory defined by series of waypoints. We assign a timestamp and a velocity to each waypoint and we can fit a curve to these waypoints to create a geometric representation of the trajectory. 
  * Since moving obstacles may block parts of the road temporarily. Each waypoint in the trajectory has a timestamp. We can combine the timestamp with the outputs of the prediction module to verify that each waypoint on the trajectory will be vacant at the time we plan to move through it. These time Stamps create a 3D trajecory: 2D position + Time. 
  ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-18%2002-01-48.png)
  * We also designate a velocity for each waypoint. The velocity ensures that the vehicle reaches each waypoint on schedule.
  * Transitions between waypoints and any changes in velocity should be smooth. The path shoudl be obstacle free. 
  * To choose a best trajectory, Use cost Function. Cost Function might include deviating from the centre of the road or from a potential collision or from exceeding the speed limit or if the curvature or acceleration of the trajectory is uncomfortable for passengers. The cost function can vary for different environments. 
* Frenet Coordinates
  * Cartesian coordinates aren't optimal for a vehicle. If we don't know where the road is. It's hard to know how far the car has traveled, or whether it's deviate from the center of the lane.
  * Frenet coordinate describe the position of a car with respect to the road. In Frenet frame, S represents the distance along the road also known as the longitudinal coordinate. D represents the displacement from the longitudinal line, also known as the lateral coordinate.
  * At every point on the road the lateral axis and the longitudinal axis are perpendicular. The longitudinal coordinate tells us how far down the road we've traveled, and the lateral coordinate tells us how far deviates from the center line. 
* Path-velocity Decoupled Planning
 divides trajectory plannign into two steps:
   * Path-planning
   * Speed-planning
 In path planning step, we generate candidate curves, which are the paths our vehicle could travel. We evaluate each path using a cost function that incorporates smoothness, safety, deviation from center of the lane, and any other factors we want to consider. We rank the paths by cost, and select the lowest-cost path. 
 The next step is to determine what speed to travel along this path. We may want to change speeds over the course of the path, So what we really need to select is a sequence of speeds associated with waypoints, rather than a single speed. This sequence is called "speed profile"
 We can use optimization to select a good speed profile for the path, subject to various constraints. The path and the speed profile, consitute a trajectory for the vehicle to travel. 
 
 ** What if there are other paths with less speed constraints, Well You can introduce this as constraint to the path function**
 
 * Path Generation and Selection
 To generate candidate paths for Path-Velocity Decoupled Planning, We start by segmenting the road into cells.
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2001-14-42.png)
 Then we randomly sample points from each of these cells. 
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2001-14-55.png)
 
 We create a candidate path by taking one point from each cell and connecting the points together.
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2001-16-52.png)
 By repeating this process we can build multiple candidate paths. 
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2001-17-23.png)
 
 We evaluate those paths using a cost function and select the path with the minimum cost.
 
 * ST Graph
 The next step after selecting a path is to select the speed profile to associate with that path. ST graph, a tool can help us design and select the speed profile. In ST graph, S represents the longitudinal displacement of the vehicle and T represents time. A curve on a ST graph is a description of the vehicles movement since it illustrates the vehicle position across time. Speed is the rate at which position changes, So we can infer speed from an ST graph by looking at the slope of the curve. 
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-05-18.png)
 * Speed Profile
 In order to build better speed profile, we can discretize the ST graph into multiple cells. Speed changes between cells, but speed remains constant  within each cell. This approach simplifies the construction of a speed profile while maintaining an approximation of a curve. On an ST graph, obstacles can be drawn as rectangle that block off certain parts of the road during certain time periods. 
 Eg: suppose the prediction module projects that car will cut into our lane from time T0 to T1. Since that car will occupy positions S0 to S1 during that time period,  We draw a rectangle on our ST graph blocking out positions from S0 to S1 during time period To to T1. In order to avoid a collision, Our speed profile must not intersect this rectangle. 
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-09-06.png)
 

 
 Now that we have an ST graph with various cells blocked off, We can use an optimization engine to select the best speed profile for the graph. 
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-10-28.png)

 
 The optimization engine uses complex mathematics to search for low cost solution subject to various constraints.

 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-12-07.png)

 
 * Optimization
 Path-velocity decoupled planning depends heavily on didscretization. Path selection involves dividing the road into cells and speed profile construction involves dividing the ST graph into cells. 
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-14-16.png)
 
 Discretization makes these problems easier to solve, but the solutions aren't smooth.
 ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-21-13.png)
 
 In order to convert our discrete solutions into smooth trajectory, we can use quadratic programming. **Quadratic programming fits a smooth non-linear curve to these piecewise linear segments**. 
 
 Once our path and speed profile are ready. we can use them to construct a 3D trajectory. 
 
* Trajectory Generation for Path Velocity Planning
Imagine we are driving down the road and our perception system observes that we're closing the gap on a slow moving vehicle. 
First, we generate multiple candidate paths around this vehicle. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-31-35.png)

We evaluate those candidate paths using a cost function, and we select the lowest cost path. Then, we use an ST Graph for speed planning. We block off parts of the ST Graph based on the position of other vehicles over time. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-38-04.png)
And optimization helps us identify the best speed profile for this graph subject to constraints in teh cost function. We can apply quadratic programming to smooth the path and the speed profile. Finally, we can bind the path and speed profile together to construct a trajectory.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2002-40-47.png)

Blue indicates slower speed and Red indicates Higher speed(relative). We use this trajectory to overtake the other vehicle safely. 

* Lattice Planning
Let's consider a trajectory generation approach called the lattice planning.  Using Frenet coordinates, we can project  our environment onto a longitudinal axis and a lateral axis. 

goal: generate a trajectory in three dimensions: a longitudinal dimension, a lateral dimension and a time dimension. 
We can decompose the the three dimensional problem into two separate two-dimensional probelms by separating the longitudinal and the lateral components of the trajectory. 
One two-dimensional trajectory would be the longitudinal trajectory with timestamps. we call this the ST trajectory.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-12-59.png)
The other two-dimensional trajectory would be the lateral offset relative to the longitudinal trajectory.  We call this SL trajecory.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-14-35.png)

Lattice planning is the two step process of first developing the ST and SL trajectories independently and then combining them. To generate the two dimensional longitudinal and lateral trajectories, we start by projecting  the initial vehicle state onto the ST coordinate frame and the SL coordinate frame. We select the ending state of the vehicle by sampling multiple candidate ending states from pre-selected patterns.
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-19-49.png)

For each candidate ending state, we build a set of trajectories to transition our vehicle from its initial state to the ending state. We evaluate these trajectories using costfuntion and select the lowest cost function trajectory.

Depending on the situation we can sample ending states from three groups, 
  * cruising(We'were sampling points on a graph where the horizontal axis represents time and teh vertical axis represents velocity. For a point on this graph, that means a car will enter a cruising state at a speed of S. at time t. For this patter, the acceleration for all ending states is zero)
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-29-33.png)
  * following(We sample both position and time, which means we would try to appear behind a certain car at time t. To follow that car, we need to allow a safe distance, so velocity and acceleration depend on the lead vehicle.That means in this pattern both velocity and acceleration are fixed.) 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-33-04.png)
  * stopping(For this patter, we just need to sample where and when the vehicle would stop. In this scenario, we fix both velocity and acceleration to zero)
  ![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-32-42.png)

* Ending states for SL Trajectories
We perform SL planning based on an assumption that the car should steadily align with the central line of the lane no matter what ending state it would enter. This means we only need to sample lateral ending positions within a small area. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-37-40.png)

we sample positions around the center lines of adjacent lanes of the road. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-40-01.png)
To ensure stability, the ending state for the cars heading should align with the center of the lane. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-40-36.png)

When we plot the lateral position against the longitudinal position, the candidate trajectory we want should end with the vehicle aligned with the lane and driving straight. 
![](https://github.com/sriharsha0806/Apollo/blob/master/Screenshot%20from%202018-07-19%2004-42-00.png)

In order to achieve this state, the first order and second order derivatives of heading and position should both be zero. This means the vehicle is neither moving laterally(first order derivative),nor accelerating laterally(second order derivative)

* Polynomial
How do we connect the initial state and the ending state?
We will fit a polynomial to this two two conditions. Here, the initial conditions and end conditions are both tuples with position, speed, and acceleration on s coordinate. Note that speed is the first order derivative of position and acceleration is the second order derivative of position. Usually, we denote the derivative with respect to time as a dot above a variable.
Initial condition we have (s_o, s^._o, s^{..}_o)

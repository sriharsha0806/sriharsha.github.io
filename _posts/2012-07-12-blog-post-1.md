This Blog post is on Summer School series on Computer Vision and Machine Learning held in IIIT Hyderabad. The Schedule of the summer schools are listed in the following links (CV)[https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/cvsummerschool2018/program.html] and (ML)(https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/mlsummerschool2018/program.html). I want to concentrate on some talks and assignments of the summer school series.
